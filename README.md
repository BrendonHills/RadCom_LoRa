# RadCom_LoRa
These files contain code relating to a RadCom article on LoRa (RadCom is the journal of the Radio Society of Great Britain - RSGB)
The RSGB is the member-body of licensed radio amateurs in the UK.
The files are designed to be used in conjunction with that article and are modified versions of examples from the 
Sandeep Mistry LoRa library, encouraging licensed radio amateurs to experiment with LoRa technology using the Adafruit Lora Feather 32u4 RFM9x boards.
Please feel free to use and modify as you wish without restriction.
Above all - enjoy!
